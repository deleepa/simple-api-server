## Simple API Server

This project is intended to serve as a starting point for anyone that wants to set up a simple NodeJS API server really fast. It's functionality is similar to a boilerplate. I started this mostly for my reference but I hope this ends up helping more people!

Eventually this I want to have a user login module as well, since that's a really basic feature that's part of any API server application. Authenticated routes would also be included.

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/deleepa/simple-api.git`
`cd simple-api`
`npm install`
`node app.js`

## Tests

I'm using the mocha test framework for this project.
